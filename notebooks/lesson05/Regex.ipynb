    "Codons are sequences of three nucleotides that correspond to a specific amino acid during translation. Not all of an mRNA transcript is translated into a protein sequence. Instead, a set of special codons signal to the translation machinery to start and stop translaton. The start codon, AUG (ATG in the DNA sequence), indicates the start of the coding region, and any one of the the three stop codons (UAA, UAG, or UGA) indicates the end of the coding region. The section of mRNA preceding the start codon is known as the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR), while the section of mRNA following the stop codon is known as the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR). Write a piece of code that locates the start and stop codons in an mRNA sequence and extracts the coding region. You might want to break the sequence up into codons to verify that the stop codon is some multiple of three nucleotdes after the start codon."
